         <p>Banff National Park, established in 1885, holds the distinction of being Canada's first national park and a cornerstone of the Canadian Rockies' World Heritage Site. Spanning over 6,641 square kilometers of unparalleled mountain landscapes, the park is a sanctuary of towering peaks, pristine turquoise lakes, verdant forests, and abundant wildlife.</p>

        <p>Lake Louise, with its emerald waters reflecting the majestic Victoria Glacier, is perhaps one of the most iconic sights in Banff. Visitors can canoe on the lake, hike to the Lake Agnes Tea House for stunning views, or simply admire the scenery from the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise.</p>

        <p>Another jewel in Banff's crown is Moraine Lake, nestled in the Valley of the Ten Peaks. Its vibrant blue waters, once featured on Canadian twenty-dollar bills, are a photographer's dream. The Rockpile Trail offers a short climb to an incredible vantage point.</p>

        <p>Beyond the lakes, Banff offers countless hiking trails, from gentle boardwalks to challenging mountain ascents. The Icefields Parkway, connecting Banff and Jasper National Parks, is a scenic drive renowned for its glaciers, waterfalls, and panoramic vistas.</p>

        <p>Wildlife enthusiasts will be thrilled by the opportunity to spot elk, deer, bighorn sheep, and even bears in their natural habitat. Remember to always observe wildlife from a safe distance and never feed them.</p>
