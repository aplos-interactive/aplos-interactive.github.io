  <h1 class="title">Nova Scotia bill allegedly threatens academic freedoms</h1>

  <section id="event">
  <p>A piece of proposed legislation in Nova Scotia has ignited worries among university professors and students. They voiced their apprehension to a legislative committee, arguing that the bill constitutes an overreach of governmental power into the affairs of the province's ten universities. The core of their concern lies in the potential erosion of academic independence due to this increased state control.</p>

  <section id="interest">
  <p>The bill proposes to link the allocation of funds to how well university programs align with the government's economic and social objectives. Critics fear this could pressure universities to undergo unplanned structural changes to meet these external demands. Furthermore, the legislation would grant the government the authority to appoint a significant portion – up to half – of each university's governing board. Peter McInnis, representing university teachers across Canada, specifically highlighted a provision allowing the Minister of Advanced Education to dictate the terms for annual research grants, warning of potential political meddling that could disrupt vital academic inquiries. He emphasized the need for a balance between governmental oversight and undue interference.</p>

  <p>Concerns were also raised about the potential sidelining of university senates, the bodies traditionally responsible for academic matters, in favor of government-influenced boards. The power granted to the advanced education minister to unilaterally decide on funding for specific programs was also heavily criticized as being unique in Canada and likely to force universities to restructure based on government whims. Cathy Conrad, a professor at Saint Mary’s University speaking for a large group of faculty and librarians, stated that the government had not consulted with academics, setting them on a "chaos course." She worried that funding would be disproportionately directed towards science and technology fields that align with economic growth, potentially at the expense of humanities and social sciences. Conrad suggested that university leaders were hesitant to speak out against the bill due to fears of losing financial support, underscoring the perceived threat to institutional autonomy.</p>

  <section id="opinion">
    <p>Students also voiced their opposition to the bill. Maren Mealey, a student at Dalhousie University, expressed alarm over the "unprecedented authority" the government would gain, particularly concerning research priorities. She argued that this could stifle academic freedom and devalue research deemed not in line with the government's current interests, asserting that researchers, not politicians, should determine research agendas. Another student, Ziggy Kirch, pointed out that the proposed changes would further reduce student representation on university boards. In response to these concerns, Advanced Education Minister Brendan Maguire told reporters that discussions with university presidents had taken place, emphasizing that the bill aims for "long-term stability," particularly in light of anticipated financial challenges due to changes in federal international student regulations. He maintained that the government's intention was not to exert control but to collaborate with universities to ensure their continued autonomy. The committee has sent the bill back to the legislature for further discussion.</p>
