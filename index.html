</h1></center>
        <p style="font-family:verdana;"> On March 18th, the Conservative government that is in power in Nova Scotia proposed a bill that would give the government more control over the province’s 10 universities. The legislation would link funding to the government’s social and economic priorities and would also allow the government to appoint up to half the members of a university’s board of governors. These changes could force universities into unplanned reorganisation based upon the government’s whims and interests, not in the interest of education. 
          This event interested me as a reader because a threat to academic freedom is a threat to freedom of speech and freedom in general. When the bill allows the government to control and decide what universities research and do, it really interested me. “This is not to suggest that governments have no practical role in advanced education, but rather a balance must be sought between oversight and interference,” said McInnis, who is an associate professor of history at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, N.S. 
          What I learned from this article was that this was even happening in the first place. It also gave me a concise and unbiased look at to what was happening and what was affected by this bill. 
          My opinions on this bill proposed by the Conservative government that is in power in Nova Scotia is that university senates, which deal with academic issues, shouldn’t be removed in favour of boards of governors stacked with government appointees. I also think that this bill will give students even less representation on university boards and decisions. This might also give science and technology studies that might give the province more revenue more money to the detriment of arts history and other programs. “Nova Scotia universities deserve support for their missions in tandem with appropriate oversight rather than being subject to arbitrary and partisan political control,” said Saint Mary’s University professor Cathy Conrad. Another professor, McInnis who works at St Francis Xavier University said, “This is a power accorded to no other province and would force universities to restructure according to government direction,” I feel this bill is not needed and is only being proposed to give the government more money after the change in federal immigrations laws at the expense of academic freedom.<p>
