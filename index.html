    On March 18th, the Conservative government in Nova Scotia proposed a bill that would give the government more control over the province’s 10 universities. The legislation would link funding to the government’s social and economic priorities and would also allow the government to appoint up to half the members of a university’s board of governors. These changes could force universities into unplanned reorganization based on the government’s whims and interests, not in the interest of education.

    This event interested me as a reader because a threat to academic freedom is a threat to freedom of speech and freedom in general. When the bill allows the government to control and decide what universities research and do, it really concerned me. “This is not to suggest that governments have no practical role in advanced education, but rather a balance must be sought between oversight and interference,” said McInnis, an associate professor of history at St. Francis Xavier University.

    What I learned from this article was that this was even happening in the first place. It gave me a concise and unbiased look at what was happening and what could be affected by this bill.

    My opinion is that university senates, which deal with academic issues, shouldn’t be removed in favor of boards of governors stacked with government appointees. I also think that this bill will give students even less representation on university boards and decisions. It may also favor science and tech programs with higher revenue potential over arts, history, and other subjects. “Nova Scotia universities deserve support for their missions in tandem with appropriate oversight rather than being subject to arbitrary and partisan political control,” said Saint Mary’s University professor Cathy Conrad. Another professor, McInnis, stated, “This is a power accorded to no other province and would force universities to restructure according to government direction.” I feel this bill is not needed and is only being proposed to give the government more money after changes to federal immigration laws, at the expense of academic freedom.
